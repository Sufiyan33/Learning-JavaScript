Hi
Here, i am going to build a project name is : Pdf merger.
Buy using this application you can merge two or more pdf in a single file.

#Tools :

- JavaScript
- Express
- Node.js
- nodemon (similar to deveTools)

#Commands :

- Initialize a project as a Node.js or package.json file, use below command:
  - npm init -y
- Install express using below command:
  - npm i express
- Install nodemon to avoid running file again and again, means it works as devtools:
  npm i -g nodemon

  Above command will throw error: need permission. To avoid this issue type below command after that type your pc password:

  - sudo su

- Now run file using below command instead of node server.js :
  - nodemon server.js
